To install all tools:
  ./get_tools.sh

To install plink2 only:
  ./get_tools plink2
To install bcftools only:
  ./get_tools.sh bcftools
To install bgenix only:
  ./get_tools bgenix

bgenix takes a while to install so if you don't need it I recommend skipping it.

This script will NOT install things to your system, only in this folder. (pprs.R will still be able to detect the programs if you don't move it.)
