These score files were manually created using weights sourced from:
  + alzhimers: Broad Institute server /humgen/florezlab/users/ksmith/new_bNMF_analyses/alzheimers/UKBB_pPS/v11/score_info/
  + dicorpo2024: TODO (10.2337/dc21-1395)
  + suziki2024: TODO (10.1038/s41586-024-07019-6)
  + The rest: from a file Magda gave me called 'Pathway_PRS_weights.zip' (also in this directory).
    I manually annotated variants necessary columns if they were missing.
    I am guessing the weights were gotten from the following publications:
    - udler2018: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002654
    - kim2022: <TODO not sure>
    - smith2024: 10.1038/s41591-024-02865-3
    - sevilla2024: <TODO not sure>
